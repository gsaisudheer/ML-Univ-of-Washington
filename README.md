Machine Learning Specialization from University of Washington on Coursera

My scratch pads for the assignments of the following courses of Machine Learning Specialization offered on Coursera by the University of Washington. 

- Machine Learning Foundations: A case study approach
- Regression
- Classification

Most of these assignments were done using `pandas` and `scikit-learn` instead of solving them directly on the `IPython` notebooks.
